Some may call this a portfolio, but I'd rather call it my fun zone because it's barely got any info about me, but more easter eggs and cool things like:

- Live updating stats of my repos
- An original way of showing the text for contrast
- Typewriter effect for pretty much everything (thanks to that lib!!)
- Easter eggs!

## Why... did you make it?

It's made with Svelte and for the [Smelt YSWS from Hack Club](https://smelt.hackclub.com) of which one the of the requirements was to have to have easter eggs!

## How to run it locally?

Why. Just why. It's literally **my** personal website. Why on earth do you need to run it locally?
But open source is open source so:  
(Bun commands are recommended as it's faster and the one I use)

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `bun install` or `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `bun dev` or `npm run dev` to start a local server
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser (or whatever port it says in the terminal)
